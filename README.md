# opie
Opie is the desktop frand for the OP-1. 

**Pre-alpha. Currently only working on OS X. Use at your own peril, santa claus is an asshole, nothing is sacred.** If you don't know what you're doing, don't rely on this as reliable yet.

## usin' it
`opie backup` for a full backup

`opie restore` to choose a backup file and restore to a plugged-in OP-1

`opie pack make` to turn one of your user presets into a named preset in a specified folder

## features
ðŸš¼ backup & restore (currently only full backup/restore supported)

ðŸš¼ preset helper (choose your presets and make a named "pack" out of them)

## ideas
ðŸ’¡ online sound pack repository and space management, homebrew for sweet soundz

ðŸ’¡ album "import" (converting from OP-1 to WAV/FLAC via ffmpeg, possibly cutting silence and normalizing)

ðŸ’¡ firmware helper
